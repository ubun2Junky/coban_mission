Hay y'all, so I thought this was my last week here in Sayaxche, turns out it wasn't.  President left the mission for a conference, so he extended or postponed transfers for another week.  Crazy.  When they told me they were postponing I immediately thought, oh shoot, and all the people I said goodbye to?  So we kept working for another week.

We also made flour tortillas with the amazing Hna. Rosalinda.  It was super sweet, I can't even express to you guys how much I love flour tortillas!  They are soooo good.

Annndd now, this week was transfers.  We visited Hna. Marta a lot.  We even made pupusas with her.  It's always super fun being with her and her family.

My last day in Sayaxche I actually ate a turtle, which I liked...  but when it came to the feet I couldn't eat it any more!  But other than the feet, everything else was delicious!

I hope you're all doing well.  The weeks are going by fast, it's going to be November soon!  Literally so crazy!!!  But anyways, that's all for this.  I hope you all have a good one!!  Catch you guys next week.

Love you,

Ari
