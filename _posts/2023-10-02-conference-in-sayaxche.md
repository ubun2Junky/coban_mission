This week we continued to work very hard. We were extremely excited for general conference which was on Saturday and Sunday. We invited investigators, recent members, inactives, and even super awesome active members to join us.

We knew that general conference would be an exciting one. On Saturday, all of our friends showed up including a lot of the members that we had invited. It was super cool. It was very exciting to see everyone enjoy the testimonies and everything else, the spirit was strong and was felt through their testimonies.

Love Ari
