This week we started off with a great adventure to Petensito (which is a zoo close to Flores Peten). The enitire zone was planning on going, so it was good to see everyone together. The only ones that were missing were the elders from Poptun, who almost never visit us.

We were excited to our trip to Petensito....... however it turned out to be one of the most worst zoos I've ever been to. We were disappointed about the zoo but we really enjoyed our time together. After our zoo experience, we went to Burger King. We always eat Burger King after anything we do on Mondays.

This week we also got to spend a good time with Hermana Bruna, the 2nd counselor of the relief society, and the most humble  hearted person I've ever met. She's so sweet.

We had grilled chicken with rice and a pasta salad as we celebrated her birthday.  When we got there, she informed us that she burned the food a bit, her family got mad and they left the party.  She was so happy that we showed up. That was a heart warming moment.

We bought her a silleta for tortillas and something else for the kitchen. She was so happy.

I loved the experience that I got to have with Hermana Bruna. Sometimes just being there for someone is important. ðŸ’ž

Love Ari
