**Dear Possié Family,**

It's a pleasure to greet you. We inform you that, recently, your daughter Sister Possié's has been called to serve as a Zone Leader in the Guatemala Cobán mission. We have the complete assurance that this call has come from the Lord.  Your missionary now has the responsibility to teach, minister and show others how to Find, Teach, Baptize and Retain. Her leadership based on the example of the Savior and his teachings will be the hallmark of her ministry at this stage, with much love and high expectations she will elevate and bless her fellow missionaries. We invite you to pray for her in this new stage as a leader, as well, those she leads.  We are so grateful for raising and nurturing her upright and good daughter. It is truly is a privilege to collaborate with her.  We pray that the Lord bless you with the richest blessings of the gospel now and always.

With love,

President and sister Alvarado

Guatemala Cobán Mission
