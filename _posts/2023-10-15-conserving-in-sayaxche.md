No water in our neighborhood this week!  It seems like every other week the city just completely shuts off the water or the lights due to some construction project.  Not to worry, we have an emergency tank so everything was alright.  This week we continued to minister with all of our hearts.  Sunday was my turn to speak during sacrament meeting.  We had a couple of friends in attendance, it was so amazing.  What really surprised us was that a return missionary who had been inactive for the past 15 years came back to church.  When his wife approached us we were speachless, miracles do happen.  Continuously inviting people to come to church might feel like nagging, but some people just need a little consistency to trust others.
