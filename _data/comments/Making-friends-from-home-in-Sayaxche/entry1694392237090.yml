message: "Finally Ari, I’ve found your blog. For some unknown reason couldn’t get it for a few weeks.  Your mom, Ashley, and Lauren just left, they came to get some Iris plants your mom wants to transplant. ( you know I love irises!)\r\nIt’s so good to see your photos and learn about the things that are keeping you busy. Ukulele song sounds very good, especially with only 3 days of practice!\r\nGrandpa and I are fine, just the usual keeping ourselves busy. Autumn is just beginning here and autumn is my fav season. A couple lovely trees in the neighborhood have turned pretty colors, nights are cooler, and it’s time to start cleaning up gardens, flowerbeds, etc. we want to get Utah family up here soon for a picnic and fun time together. Everyone stays so busy especially now that school has started up again. You take care of yourself!-keep eating your comps meat to beef yourself up\U0001F609. Love you and you’re always in our prayers."
