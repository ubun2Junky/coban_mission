message: "What an excellent experience!!  Those are normally the very memorable ones.  Anayeli must have a very special spirit about her to have the adversary through everything he had her way.  She will do amazing things in that little branch as she grows!  Congratulations!!\r\n\r\nSo it's official...  you're getting transferred.  Change is always scary but it can also be very exciting.  The Lord has a plan for you and you're now needed somewhere else.  New adventure, new challenges to overcome and new opportunities to grow!  \r\n\r\nLove you, Dad."
