message: "Just remember that you are there to server EVERYONE in Guatemala.  You're a missionary 24/7 to everyone and everywhere you go.  That includes investigators, members, church leaders, missionaries and even your companion.  There is a lesson to be learned in every challenge you'll face.  You've been given all the tools you need to over come the obstacles thrown at you.  The challenges can be tough, but just know that you're not alone.  You have the Spirit to guide you every step of the way.\r\nYou must be doing something right.  The adversary would not waste his time with you if he didn't feel you were a threat to his plan.\r\nWe love you so very much, keep your head high and push forward.  No fear and no regrets."
