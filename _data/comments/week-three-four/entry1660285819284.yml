message: "The poor Elder didn't know what hit him!  Nothing says welcome to Mexico better than 130lbs of luggage from behind!\r\nSister Trainer Leader, sounds very cool.  It's a great opportunity for you to serve the other missionaries at the CCM!  Did the mission president ever explain how you guys were going to be helping build the Mexico CCM temple?  I know he brought it up on the meet & greet devotional?  The other Hermanas sound like amazing people.  It never gets old to hear about everyone's stories, it builds on your testimony.\r\nIt never hurts to be besties with the kitchen staff!  Especially when they're the ones that feed you!\r\nI have not doubts that you will dominate the language very quickly.  Rumor has it Spanish won't be the only language you learn on this mission??\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nDad."
