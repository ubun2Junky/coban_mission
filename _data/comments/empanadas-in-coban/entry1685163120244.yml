message: "Can’t wait to try all the amazing dishes you’re learning out there!!  Argentine empanadas are the best!!  I could eat them all day/!!  I’m sorry to hear about Hna. Sosa and Woodling.  That really sucks!  Getting sick in Guate, specially with parasites is not joke!  Stay safe and watch what you eat!\r\n\r\nAlso, if you haven’t already, invest in some good rubber rain boots.  Foot and nail fungus occur when you get nasty street water on your feet!"
