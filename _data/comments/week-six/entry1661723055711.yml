message: "I was grateful that I got a chance to chat with you twice in one week!!  That made my week!  I was impressed with how much more verbal you've become with your Spanish.  You can certainly tell that you're becoming a bit more confident and you're able to express yourself much better.  All this in about a six week span!  Can't wait to see your progress by the end of this year.  You'll be fluent!\r\n\r\nThe CCM is definitely a special place, you'll cherish the people you met and experiences you shared there."
