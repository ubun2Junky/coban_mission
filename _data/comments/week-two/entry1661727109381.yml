  I had to learn that lesson the hard way at the MTC as well.  A Spaniard sister
  showed me a photo of herself in a traditional Spaniard dress.  I told her she
  looked very 'chula'.  If looks could kill!  She and her companion (also from
  Spain) just about killed me.  They didn't talk to me for several days until
  the instructor called them out, since he sensed some tension in the class. 
  Come to find out the Sisters interpreted 'chula' as a woman of the night!
  However when we compared the word in our dictionaries my Mexican dictionary
  said 'pretty', while their dictionary from Spain said it was a lower class
  woman or prostitute.  So...  slang never a good thing to use, especially when
  you're dealing with people from various parts of the world.
