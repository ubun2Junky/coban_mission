message: "Hello Ari!  Grandpa and I just read your message, enjoyed your photos and loved your video!  I don’t know why we hadn’t seen this sooner.  It was interesting to hear how Christmas is celebrated there. It’s GREAT to hear that baptisms are happening and even better to see you so happy and looking beautiful.  ( I love your cute little hat\U0001F44D).\r\nWe are both well, Gramps is just getting ready to leave for his day at the temple. He missed both days last week because of a virus going around. After he started feeling better I of course got it-cough and congestion and sore throat.  Today I’m starting to feel a tad better, or at least my sore throat is gone. We did manage to get our Christmas tree down and everything stored in totes till next year. You probably know we had a huge snowstorm New Years, piles of snow! But apparently once you got out of Morgan county the roads were not bad (they were nearly impassable here) because Melissa, Russ and kids were able to drive home. Our church services were cancelled though we didn’t even know till 2 days later because of our illness we hadn’t planned on attending. The Triplett family loved their week vacation-Disneyland of course being the highlight. All 4 kids talking at the same time, so excited! Finding shells and perfect sand dollars on the beach was also fun for them. Tessa also made it back to Utah. She enjoyed time with her family, said she was sick the first 2 days and slept mostly,plus it was really cold there but then she felt good and it heated up to typically warm Texas weather so all was good. It was nice having everyone except Kamren here Christmas Day.  And as always lots of food and fun. It was wonderful getting to see you and visit online, and hearing your sweet testimony and prayer. I’m sure our Lord and Father in Heaven are so pleased with the good person you are (and have always been) and the loving service you are giving. I too know that the gospel is true and that the guidance and direction we find living the concepts taught will bring peace and lasting joy into our lives. Keep on working hard and loving those you associate with and keep the spirit close. You are in our prayers! \r\nNow time for me to eat some breakfast !  ( maybe some blueberry morning cereal\U0001F609)\r\nI love you.\r\nGrandma"
