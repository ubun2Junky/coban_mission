message: "Grandma, thank you so much for that message. I love you too!\r\nChristmas was a wonderful experience, and I am so grateful that I have two here in Guatemala. One thing that I noticed is that almost no one recieved what we would consider a christmas present, but recieved their family there at their side. At one small point of christmas I thought to myself \"wouldnt it be nice to have my family here seeing, hearing, and experiencing the same things that I am on the mission?\" And right in that moment, one member had told me that right now for this christmas, they had wanted me to be a part of their family. \r\nSomething was very special to me about that small comment. After that comment I realized that im exactly right where i need to be now. There is no other place in the word, other than Coban Guatemala (San Jeronimo), where i needed to be. I have a huge purpose and responsibility here, and its to find my brother and sisters from heaven, and help them so we can meet again with God. \r\nI love you so much grandma! Tell grandpa that I love him too! I wish you guys all of the blessings you can possibly recieve because I know you guys deserve them. \r\nKeep on shining brightly with the light of Christ! Not only to your friends, neighbors, but our family as well. \r\nI love you guys so much! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! \r\nP.s. - I am however jealous of the blueberry morning."
