  I was hoping you'd have a Christmas update on here! I know everyone in Utah
  was excited to have such a nice call with you on Christmas Day. It sounds like
  things are going well and you survived your first Christmas away from home.
  I'm sure it felt a little strange, and you were very missed, but how fun to be
  able to celebrate in new and interesting ways too. We love your updates,
  pictures, and yay for a video! We hope you are enjoying the freshness of a new
  year.
