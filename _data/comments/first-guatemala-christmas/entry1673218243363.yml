message: "Guatemalan Christmases were always very special to me growing up.  I know that through the years we've done what we can to keep some of the traditions alive as we moved to Canada and then the US.  I hope you can see some of the parallels and perhaps have a better understanding of why we have tried to keep some of the traditions. Trying to celebrate Christmas in Canada and the US was never the same as in Guatemala, but perhaps being there in person you can see and appreciate it better!\r\n\r\nIt was always a special time of the year, the presents really never mattered, but being around the family was always the highlight.  We missed you this year, but know that you were always in our hearts and mind.  You are a special gift to the people of your area  whether they know it or not.  Keep up the great work Ari, know that we all love you very dearly.\r\n\r\nLove Papi."
