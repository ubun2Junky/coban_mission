message: "I'm so relieved to have finally heard from you.  I was sure you were okay, but still I needed a bit of reassurance that you had no complications getting through immigration and you got to the mission home okay.  I'm glad to hear that everything went splendid, heck you didn't even take out any Elders with your luggage this time, bonus!!  \r\n\r\nI can't wait to hear from you next week!  I'm curious to know who your new companion is going to be and where exactly you're going to serve!  Take care of yourself and know that we love you very much!!"
