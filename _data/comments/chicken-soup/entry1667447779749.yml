message: "I'm really glad to hear you're up and about again!  I didn't think they'd make you butcher your own chicken and make your own chicken soup though!!  I'm proud of you!  \r\n\r\nI'm glad you had a great time at the multizone conference.  Your mom and I always looked forward to getting together with the other missionaries.  Transportation wasn't a big issue for us so we did it once a week.  \r\n\r\nIt's always great to see that once in a while you get investigators that actually take you up on the challenge and it's exciting to see them grow.  It's a great experience!\r\n\r\nLove you mija, take care of yourself and we'll talk to you soon!"
