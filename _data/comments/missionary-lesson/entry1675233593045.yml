message: "Great lessons learned and great adventures!  I love the attitude, \"Go with the flow!!\"  Sometimes we just can't rely with what we planned, but we have to rely on letting the Spirit guide you to those people that need you.  Rarely do things ever go according to plan, but the spirit will always guide you to where you need to go!!  \r\n\r\nBeautiful place, La Cumbre.  It does seem very tranquil and peaceful, I can see why you like it!!\r\n\r\nLove you!!  Dad."
