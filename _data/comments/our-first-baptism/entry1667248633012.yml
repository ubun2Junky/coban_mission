message: "Well so far with the English classes we have only had one. And its for literally anyone in San Chomo (Jeronimo) who wants to learn. The only problem is that no one wants to learn. So we'll se how many want to this coming week. \r\nYesterday was really cold and really windy, but it's back and forth. I've been pumping myself up with lots of water to stay healthy enough for the weather changes. One day it'll be 80 degrees and the next it'll be 58 and rainy, big difference. \r\nI know, didn't realize warm water is a blessing till my mission!\r\nI've been taking lots and lots of notes! Thanks dad! Love you so much!"
