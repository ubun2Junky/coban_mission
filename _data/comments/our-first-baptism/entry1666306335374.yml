message: "I'm glad to hear that tropical storm Julia didn't affect you too much.  I know that when it rains in Guatemala, IT RAINS!!  Glad you stayed safe.  \r\n\r\nSo what is this that you're teaching English?  Are you teaching to other missionaries or to members? \r\n\r\nNow that there has been a change in weather, how cold do you feel it's gotten?  I'm glad you got the water heater fixed...  Even in warm areas, it's tough to shower with cold water!\r\n\r\nTake note of what it's like to be the junior companion, so WHEN you get to train, you're able to be a more effective and empathetic trainer. \r\n\r\nLove you lots, take care of yourself."
