  Alright, I’m expecting lots of delicious food and maybe a cooking class or two
  when you’re home and I’m there to visit. You’re going to know how to make such
  yummy and unique food. Make sure you’re writing down recipes to bring home
  with you. Even better if you can get the women who teach you to write them
  down for you, that’d be a treasure to take into the rest of your life from
  your mission.
