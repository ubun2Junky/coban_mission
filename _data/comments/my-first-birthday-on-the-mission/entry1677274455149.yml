message: "Happy birthday Ari!!!  You are 20 years old, can you believe it??   It looks like you had a great birthday surrounded by missionaries, friends and members that love you!  You'll always remember this birthday since it will be the only one you get on the mission!  The next you'll have to share with your red headed twin at home next year!  ;)\r\n\r\nYou're in Cob√°n for your new area with Hna. Delgado.  She seems like a nice sister, I hope you two are able to work together and get the work done!  Take care of yourself and we look forward to hearing from you next week.\"\r\n\r\nLove Dad"
