message: "I'm excited for your new area!  I'm not familiar with it, but after some Googling, it looks like you're surrounded by lots of ruins.  Unfortunately you have to take a boat to get to them, so I'm not sure you'll be able to go.  Them spider sure love to follow you everywhere you go!  Your companion seems really nice!  I hope things go well with you two.\r\nThank you for the birthday wishes!  I had a great time, everyone made me feel special!  Wish you were here, but you'll be back soon enough!  Big hugs and kisses from all of us.  We love you very much!"
