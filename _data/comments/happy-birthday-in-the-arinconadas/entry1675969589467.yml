message: "Leave it to you to pick up the never blow out candles!!  It looks like she really enjoyed her birthday.  You always have a way to make special days that extra special!!  \r\nI'm excited about Anallely, I hope things go well for her this time.  It's tough when you lack support, especially from family.  I'm sure you'll make that occasion even more special for her!\r\nLet us know what happens with transfers.  I know it can get a little nerve racking but things will be okay!\r\nLove you and hope to hear from you soon.  \r\n\r\nDad"
